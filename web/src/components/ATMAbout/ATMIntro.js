                Hong Kong ATM Locator is an information service providing all ATM information in Hong Kong. The original data is provided by each bank Open APIs following the framework published by The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). 
                As each bank has implemented its group standard for implementing Open APIs at global or regional levels, the overall interoperability is frustrating. 
                In order to increase the interoperability and fulfil the industryâ€™s desire to see a common set of Open APIs, the data utilized in Hong Kong ATM Locator has been transformed and enriched to a standardised schema and will be released to the general public.
